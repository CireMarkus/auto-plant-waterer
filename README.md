This project aims to create a low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) solution for monitoring house plants. It currently includes a capacitive moisture sensor, a temperature and humidity sensor, and a light sensor that is run on a Raspberry Pi Zero W. The long-term goal is to send the data over Bluetooth to paired phones and then implement communication over the Internet.
