# 🌱 Auto Plant Waterer

An automated plant care system built with Python and basic electronics. The Auto Plant Waterer monitors soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and ambient light — and performs actions based on sensor data, such as logging the readings to a NoSQL database. Perfect for smart home integration, remote gardening, or just keeping your plants healthy while you're away.
